# Naming Decision Document

## Final Decision: `git-ok`

### The Journey

We started with `git-sync-check` which was descriptive but:
- Too long (14 characters)
- Not entirely accurate (we check more than just sync)
- Lacks memorability

### Key Requirements

1. **Accurate**: Reflects what the tool actually does
2. **Simple**: Easy to type and remember  
3. **Practical**: Works well in command line usage

### What This Tool Really Does

The tool answers one fundamental question: **"Is this repository OK to delete/archive?"**

It checks:
- Working directory state (uncommitted changes, stash, operations in progress)
- Repository configuration (remotes, branch tracking)
- Sync status (ahead/behind/diverged)
- Important local-only files (configs, databases, certificates)

### Candidates Considered

1. **`git-ok`** âœ… (CHOSEN)
   - Pros: Minimal (6 chars), intuitive, no conflicts, Unix philosophy
   - Cons: Might be too simple without context

2. **`repo-ok`**
   - Pros: Semantically accurate (we check the whole repo)
   - Cons: Less discoverable in git ecosystem

3. **`git-check`**
   - Pros: Clear function
   - Cons: Too generic, lacks personality

4. **`git-ready`**
   - Pros: Positive connotation
   - Cons: Ambiguous (ready for what?)

5. **`repostat`**
   - Pros: Follows Unix naming (like netstat)
   - Cons: Already exists, suggests statistics not safety check

### Why `git-ok`?

1. **Ecosystem Integration**: The `git-*` pattern immediately signals this is a Git tool
2. **Search Optimization**: Users naturally search for "git" tools
3. **Simplicity**: "OK" is universally understood
4. **Unix Philosophy**: Simple name, clear purpose, can be used in conditionals
5. **No Conflicts**: Completely original in the Git ecosystem

### Usage Philosophy

```bash
# Simple check
git-ok

# Conditional usage  
git-ok && echo "Safe to delete!"

# Scriptable
if git-ok; then
    archive_repository
fi
```

The name embodies the tool's essence: a simple yes/no answer to whether your repository is in a good state.
